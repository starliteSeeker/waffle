# Waffle

Tilemap editor for SNES backgrounds

# Build

~~works on my machine~~ 

## Linux

```sh
#gtk version 4.6, but should(?) work for versions < 4.10
apt install libgtk-4-dev build-essential
#make sure rustup is installed, then
cargo build --release
```

# Future plans

Not much. If I ever feel like it, some important/quality-of-life features to add include:

- undo/redo
- 4bpp backgrounds
- select mode on tilemap
